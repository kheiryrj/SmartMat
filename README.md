# SmartMat
pc-software.py: The original python code used to display the serial data from the arduino

sensorMatrixArduino.ino: The final arduino code to run our final prototype

sensorMatrixArduino.py:The final python code to run our display (current stance and where to move to)

sensor_matrix_arduino.ino: One of the original arduino codes that we based our final code off of. This one created libraries but the libraries did not work as expected (speed up the display of data)

sensor_matrix_arduino_2.ino: One of the arduino codes we used to outline our final code. 

How to run code:
1. Set up arduino and upload the code to the arduino
    * Do NOT open the serial monitor
2. Open a terminal
    - run python code using the command: python3 sensorMatrixArduino.py
    - a window should pop up with the graphic interface
3. The mat is ready for use
